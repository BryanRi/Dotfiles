* Dotfiles
This repo is a collection of my dotfiles. They should work on any Unix
based OS and are used by me on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The most note worthy
configs are:
- =awesomewm=, --- Window manager
- =bash=, =fish= --- Shells
- =(n)vim= --- Editor
- =vifm= --- File manager
- =emacs= --- Productivity environment
- And many other (mostly terminal) programs.
There are also lots of usefull scripts in =.local/bin=.

* Other configs
I also use some Suckless software that each have their own dedicated repo.
- [[https://github.com/BryanRi/dwm][dwm]] --- Window manager
- [[https://github.com/BryanRi/dmenu][dmenu]] --- Dynamic menu
- [[https://github.com/BryanRi/st][st]] --- Terminal

* Dotfile management
I manage my dotfiles using the git bare repo method, discribed in this [[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles][article]].

#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone --bare git@github.com:BryanRi/Dotfiles.git $HOME/.dots
function dots {
   /usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dots/ --work-tree=$HOME $@
}
config checkout
if [ $? = 0 ]; then
  echo "Checked out config.";
  else
    mkdir -p .config-backup
    echo "Backing up pre-existing dot files.";
    dots checkout 2>&1 | egrep "\s+\." | awk {'print $1'} | xargs -I{} mv {} .config-backup/{}
    config checkout
fi;
dots config status.showUntrackedFiles no
