* Dotfiles
This repo is a collection of my dotfiles. They should work on any Unix
based OS and are used by me on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The most note worthy
configs are:
- =awesomewm=, --- Window manager
- =bash=, =fish= --- Shells
- =(n)vim= --- Editor
- =vifm= --- File manager
- =emacs= --- Productivity environment
- And many other (mostly terminal) programs.
There are also lots of usefull scripts in =.local/bin=.

* Other configs
I also use some Suckless software that each have their own dedicated repo.
- [[https://github.com/BryanRi/dwm][dwm]] --- Window manager
- [[https://github.com/BryanRi/dmenu][dmenu]] --- Dynamic menu
- [[https://github.com/BryanRi/st][st]] --- Terminal

* Dotfile management
I manage my dotfiles using the git bare repo method, discribed in this [[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles][article]].
