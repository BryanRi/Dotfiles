# Simple script to change the screen brightness
#
# Copy this script to /usr/local/bin and add /usr/local/bin/chbrightness to the
# visudoers file to the commands that can be run without password, i.e.
# <username> ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/chbrightness
# where <username> is replaced with your username.
# Then you can keybind chbrightness + and chbrightness - to some keybindings to
# change your screen brightness.
#
# to find the proper path to the brightness file use
# $ sudo find /sys/ -name brightness
